        "question": " Xiaohua's father recently purchased a car, and Xiaohua used his physics knowledge to conduct a series of explorations and research on the car. After reading the engine manual of the sedan, Xiaohua made a diagram showing the flow of energy in an internal combustion engine as shown in Figure A. The efficiency of an engine is the ratio of the useful work output (work done by the engine's traction force) to the heat released from fuel combustion. The calorific value of gasoline is 4.6×10^7J/kg, and the specific heat capacity of cooling water is 4.2×10^3J/(kg·℃). According to the given information: If the sedan travels in straight-line motion at constant power on a flat road, the resistance it encounters remains constant during uniform linear motion, with a magnitude of 2000N. The relationship between the speed v and time t of the vehicle's motion is depicted in Figure B. Please calculate the work done by the sedan's engine on the external environment within the 0~10s period; In the 0~10s time interval, the speed of the sedan is 30m/s.\n\n",

There is a four-cylinder engine with the main technical indicators as shown in the table. In this case, the displacement equals the sum of the working volumes of the four cylinders, where the working volume refers to the swept volume V when the piston moves from the top dead center to the bottom dead center, also known as single-cylinder displacement, which depends on the area S of the piston and the distance L (i.e., stroke length) that the piston moves up and down. The rotational speed indicates the number of revolutions per minute of the crankshaft or flywheel. Cylinders can be regarded as cylindrical.
