Xiaoming wonders: How much natural gas is needed to boil a kettle of water? He collected the following data through practice: 2000 cm^3 of water at 20°C is placed in the kettle and heated on high until boiling. From a physics book, he found that the calorific value of natural gas is 8*10^7 J/m^3. [The pressure is 1 standard atmosphere; c_water = 4.2*10^3 J/(kg·°C)]. If the efficiency of Xiaoming's household gas stove is 40%, how many m^3 of natural gas are needed to boil this kettle of water? The density of water is 1.0 g/cm^3. The final temperature of water is [X]. The answer to the above question is [Y]. The value of the unrelated parameter  operating time of water heater is 20 min。.Under the International System of Units (with the exception that temperature is expressed in degrees Celsius), the value of the numerical expression y * 7000 - x * 1 of the physical quantities corresponding to [X] and [Y], is the same as the result of the following independent problem: Xiaoming is designing a circuit experiment. In his experimental setup, he connects a resistor and a battery with a voltage of 9.4 volts. It is known that the ammeter reading shows a current of 0.2 amperes flowing through the resistor. What is the resistance value of this resistor?",

Scientists estimate that the global marine floor has a distribution of combustible ice over an area of about 40 million square kilometers, with reserves sufficient for human use for about 1000 years. The South China Sea bed in our country holds abundant combustible ice resources, with known reserves equivalent to one-third of the current total of onshore oil and natural gas resources. The main component of combustible ice is methane, with 1m^3 of combustible ice able to transform into 164m^3 of methane gas and 0.8m^3 of water.

What is the pressure on the track when the fully loaded train is stationary on a horizontal track? The answer to the above question is [Y].

One day, a metal component weighing 750 tons needs to be lifted to the top level of the warehouse for installation. The crane's cable hangs vertically, fully bearing the weight of this metal component. Assuming the gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s², what is the tension force experienced by the cable in newtons?",

The density of diesel is ρ=0.85*10^3kg/m^3, and the calorific value is q=4.3*10^7J/kg. Find: the pressure exerted by the stationary truck on the horizontal road surface; the answer to the above question is [Y]. The value of the unrelated parameter  the volume of natural gas consumed is 0.07 m^3。.Under the International System of Units (with the exception that temperature is expressed in degrees Celsius), the value of the numerical expression y * 10 - x * 1 of the physical quantities corresponding to [X] and [Y], is the same as the result of the following independent problem: Problem: One night, three scientists were conducting an experiment on electric charge in a laboratory.

            "en": "The Three Gorges Dam is the largest water conservancy project in China, as shown in the figure. The dam controls a drainage area of approximately 1.0*10^6 km^2, accounting for 56% of the Yangtze River Basin. The average annual flow at the dam site is Q = 4.51*10^{11} m^3. The primary tasks of the dam include flood control, power generation, and navigation. In terms of power generation, the Three Gorges Power Plant has installed a total of 32 hydroelectric generating units of 7*10^5 kW each, along with 2 additional power supply units of 5*10^4 kW each. The total installed capacity (referring to the total power output when all 34 generators are operating simultaneously) is P = 2.25*10^7 kW, with an estimated annual power generation of W = [X] kW•h. Based on the above information, answer the following question (where the density of water ρ = 1.0*10^3 kg/m^3, and g = 10 N/kg): If all 34 generators are generating electricity, what is the average annual generating time t per generator in days to meet the required annual power generation? The answer is [Y]. The value of the unrelated parameter  calorific value of alcohol is 3×10^7 J/kg。.Under the International System of Units (with the exception that temperature is expressed in degrees Celsius), the value of the numerical expression y * 50000000000 - x * 1 of the physical quantities corresponding to [X] and [Y], is the same as the result of the following independent problem: A star in the Milky Way has erupted, generating a massive electric current lasting 100 seconds. Assume that the energy release of the star is entirely converted into electrical current and that the resistance of the star remains constant at 1 ohm during this process. It is observed that the total amount of charge transferred during the star's eruption is 4.392e+19 coulombs. Please calculate the intensity of the current produced by this star eruption in amperes.",
