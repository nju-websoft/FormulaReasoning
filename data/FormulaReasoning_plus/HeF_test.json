The emissions from these vehicles are water, producing no pollutants, and they represent a major development direction for new energy vehicles worldwide. Assume that a domestically made hydrogen fuel cell vehicle has a total mass of [X] kg. In a certain test, when the vehicle was traveling at a constant speed, the resistance it encountered was 0.02 times the weight of the vehicle. During 0.5 hours, it covered a distance of 28 km, consuming 0.4 kg of hydrogen energy (ignoring the effect of hydrogen fuel consumption on the vehicle's mass). Calculate the work done by the traction force on the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle during this test. (Given q_hydrogen = 1.4*10^8 J, g = 10 N/kg) The answer to the above question is [Y]. The value of the unrelated parameter  final water temperature is 80 ℃。.Under the International System of Units (with the exception that temperature is expressed in degrees Celsius), the value of the numerical expression x * 100000 - y * 1 of the physical quantities corresponding to [X] and [Y], is the same as the result of the following independent problem: A large spaceship is charging at a space station and has stored enough power for long-distance travel. To check the battery performance, engineers decide to calculate the electromotive force (emf) of the spaceship's battery. It is known that the spaceship's battery can normally operate with a current of 236,000 amperes with an internal resistance of 2000 ohms. What is the electromotive force in volts of this spaceship's battery?",

He sets the \"water volume\" of the household automatic washing machine to 40L, and uses hot water output from the heater to fill the washing machine. When the injected water volume reaches 40L, the washing machine automatically stops injecting water.

Instead, the power battery supplies energy to the wheels through the electric motor. The internal combustion engine only starts working when driving at high speeds or when the energy consumption of the power battery is too high. It can provide power to the wheels and simultaneously drive the motor to generate electricity, charging the power battery. During a certain journey, the hybrid electric vehicle traveled at a constant speed of 16 km on a straight and level road. It experienced a resistance of [X] while traveling.

There is a four-cylinder engine, with its main technical specifications listed in the table. The displacement equals the total working volume of the four cylinders. The working volume of a cylinder refers to the volume V swept by the piston from the top dead center to the bottom dead center, also known as the single-cylinder displacement, which depends on the area S of the piston and the distance L the piston moves up and down (i.e., the stroke length). The speed indicates the number of rotations made by the crankshaft or flywheel per minute. A cylinder can be considered as a cylindrical body.

They studied the working condition of the water dispenser and found that when the temperature of the water in the heating water tank reached 90℃, the thermostat switch would automatically cut off and stop heating; when the water temperature dropped to 60℃, the thermostat switch would automatically turn on and reheat. The heating time each time is t=4min. It is known that the specific heat capacity of water c_water = 4.2*10^3 J/(kg⋅℃). Find: rated voltage 220V, heating power [X], heating method electric heating. The advantage of the water dispenser's design with a heating tank is that it heats a small amount of water each time, allowing people to drink hot water in a shorter time and avoiding the waste of heating too much water at once. Based on the above data, calculate the mass of the water in the heating tank. Assume that the consumed electrical energy is completely converted into the internal energy of the water. The result should retain two decimal places. The answer to the above question is [Y]. The value of the unrelated parameter  contact area between wheel and ground is 0.2 m^2。.Under the International System of Units (with the exception that temperature is expressed in degrees Celsius), the value of the numerical expression x * 1 - y * 300 of the physical quantities corresponding to [X] and [Y], is the same as the result of the following independent problem: A ship sails at a constant speed of 10.0 meters per second on a calm sea. The crew drops a rope from the stern, with one end tied to a buoy. When the crew observes that the horizontal distance between the buoy and the stern reaches 2350 meters, what is the elapsed time from when the rope was dropped?",

Some unscrupulous merchants, in order to make huge profits, often mix liquefied petroleum gas with dimethyl ether, which is cheaper and has a calorific value of only 2.9*10^7 J/kg, and sell it to customers in cylinders. The Quality Supervision Bureau of Changzhou City tested the bottled gas sold by a certain liquefied petroleum gas station: water with a mass of [X] and an initial temperature of 31℃ was placed in a container, and the gas in the cylinder was burned using a high-efficiency stove to heat the water in the container until it just boiled at 100℃. The gas consumption in the cylinder was 0.84 kg. Through the high-efficiency stove, the water can absorb 75% of the heat released by the complete combustion of the gas.

If the speed for the entire trip is 70 km/h, answer the following questions: The car's mass is 1.6*10^3 kg, the total mass of Xiaoke and his family is [X]. Each tire has a contact area of 200 cm^2 with the ground, and g is taken as 10 N/kg. Calculate the pressure exerted by the car on the ground. The answer to the above question is [Y]. The value of the unrelated parameter  heat value is 4×10^7 J/kg。.Under the International System of Units (with the exception that temperature is expressed in degrees Celsius), the value of the numerical expression x * 10000 - y * 1 of the physical quantities corresponding to [X] and [Y], is the same as the result of the following independent problem: In a certain town, there is a large solar power plant with solar panels laid completely flat in a level area.
